- **Moderation commands:** Also, it has some very useful and complete moderation commands. (Ban, kick, mute, etc...) When you a moderator use them, the command will connect with the database and grab the mod log channel specified in the server configuration and send a message there with all the info of the moderation action, and also, a message will arrive in the user's DM advertising him of what he has done.
- **Ticket system:** If you have any idea, suggestion, found a bug, issue... You can send the Dev team a ticket, and it will answer you ASAP. The best thing is that you don't need to be in the suppot server for sending tickets. It works through a command (ticket). When the Dev team answers you, you will get a DM from Alexis.
